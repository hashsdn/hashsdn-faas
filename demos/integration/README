* This directory contains test scripts that run integration tests.

* runTests.sh is the executable that runs the tests (All other scripts in
  this directory are intentionally set as non-executables). 
  
* runTests.sh also serves as a test case registery. Please add/register new test cases in
  that file (The actual implementation of the test cases, however, are in those python 
  scripts. See testCases.py).

* For the usage of runTests.sh, run: ./runtests.sh -h
